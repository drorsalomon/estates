                h2.invest-content-big-title(dir='ltr') Construction and Purchasing New Projects Globally
                div.invest-content-text(dir='ltr') You can purchase an existing or new property in various countries, depending on personal preference and yield potential. In recent years, investing in new projects has become popular due to lower prices and strict legal guarantees.
                div.invest-content-text(dir='ltr') Buying an apartment "off-plan" allows you to enter an investment earlier, but it is vital to ensure clear supervision mechanisms for construction progress and fund security. Every country has laws and regulations designed to protect the investor and ensure the process meets standards.
                div.invest-content-text(dir='ltr') Supervision stages and approvals vary by country, but the principle is similar – transparency, responsibility, and full control over the establishment process until the property is handed over to the investor.
